    <h2>Project Description</h2>

    <div class="section-landing">
        <p> 
            The Baxter Creek Watershed Alliance, working out of the Cavan-Monaghan and Baxter Creek area, is a community-based, 
            non-profit organization, that is focused on the environment. Watersheds are the cornerstone of hydrology and understanding 
            the impacts of watersheds on the environment and water quality is important. Therefore, working towards a clean and healthy watershed, 
            protecting water at its source, is a key strategy for the Baxter Creek Watershed Alliance. Educating the public on the importance of a healthy watershed, 
            is another goal for the Baxter Creek Watershed Alliance, in order to ensure the local watershed environment is healthy for years to come. The Baxter Creek 
            Watershed Alliance has been actively creating collaborative projects with Fleming College and has had two prior projects with the program. Team “Bax Creeks Back” 
            has come in for the third project entitled “Phase Three”. This phase of the project developed important resources for the Baxter Creek Watershed Alliance to help 
            facilitate important geographical analysis to help better understand Baxter Creek watershed. The team has created 3 products; a 2D relational hydrologic Geodatabase 
            resource, to facilitate a better watershed planning and analysis and to give the Baxter Creek Watershed Alliance a foundational outline for an increasingly complex hydrology 
            Geodatabase, a 3D digital twin of the built-up area of Millbrook that showcases Buildings, Trees and Powerlines, and can be used better environmentally conscious planning 
            and a StoryMap that showcases the two other products on their website. By advancing the Baxter Creek Watershed Alliance’s resources, the team will help to 
            facilitate the vision of a clean and healthy watershed.
