            <h3> Overview </h3>
            <p> 
            ArcGIS Pro is a software created by ESRI that allow GIS professionals to create maps in 2D and 3D, analyze spatial data, and customize the appearance of the data. The data collection points are added to the local scene. The basemap is OSM 3D building that is load for the local scene. Click the symbology of the tree point data and change the symbol for 3D trees. We do this to apply the proper height onto the tree through symbology.         
            </p>

            <h3> Overview </h3>
            <p> 
            Go to layer properties of the tree point data and enable 3D symbols in real world units. Go to the symbology for the points and under the “vary symbology by attribute”, click on size. Select the z-value for the field. By applying the z-value for the field for the tree data collection as height. The trees didn’t show their true elevation in the model, and this was problem that was also found in ArcGIS Online.

            <h3> Overview </h3>
            <p> 
            Experience Builder is an application created by ESRI to allow user to create web pages without having any experience with coding. This allow users to add widgets and web maps to be customized to their liking.          
            </p>

            Figure 1: The image displayed above is the ArcGIS Experience Builder of the tree data collected from Field Maps. The Experience Builder allows users to toggle on and off between the 3D web scene and a 2D map of the collected tree data. The image shows the web map of the trees in 3D, but their height is not presented properly. The data in the 3D scene were using the z-values for height, however the projection of the tree’s height was incorrect.

            Figure 2: The image shows the 2D point of the tree data collected, however the two points that are far away from the ones in a line were selected for testing. These outliner points were examined to see if the elevation were corrected in ArcGIS Pro, but it appears they were not.

            <h2> Dashboards (AGOL) </h2>
            <h3> Overview </h3>
            <p> 
            ArcGIS Dashboards are a solution to present spatial information in a simple format. 
            </p>
            <p> 
            Dashboards can display ArcGIS Onlines Scenes similar to how they display Webmaps. 
            </p>
            <img src="img/Dashboard.PNG" alt="Screenshot of Dashboard with Scene" class="imgs">
            <p> 
            In the Dashboard, Scenes can be interactive. For example, there are pop-ups on the data points. Also, they have the ability to make selecting surrounding elements create actions on the scene and other surrounding elements.
            </p>
            <img src="img/DashboardPopup.PNG" alt="Dashboard with a pop up" class="imgs">

            When items on the List element are selected. It is reflected in the chart and scene. 
            </p>

            <p> 
            One notable difference in having a scene in a dashboard rather than a webmap is an action can't be created to cause the surrounding elements to change based on what is in the view on the scene.

            <h2> Scene Viewer (AGOL) </h2>
            <h3> Overview </h3>
            <p> 
            Scene viewer was the most tempting option for showcasing points in 3D from a hosted feature layer that could be updated from field maps or survey123. It had 3d basemaps with 3d building a topology that gave
            a general feeling of a 3D environment and allowed for different options to showcase how points elevation is display. The four options were "On the Ground", "Relative to the ground", "Relative to the Scene" and "absolute Height".
            </p>
            <h3>Screen Captures showcasing the Elevation settings</h3>
            <h4>On the Ground</h4>
            <img src="img/OntheGround.png" alt="image showcasing sample points in scene viewer using the elevation setting On the Ground" class="imgs">
            <h4>Relative to the ground</h4>
            <img src="img/RelitivetoGround.png" alt="image showcasing sample points in scene viewer using the elevation setting Relative to the ground" class="imgs">
            <h4>Relative to the Scene</h4>
            <img src="img/RelitivetoScene.png" alt="image showcasing sample points in scene viewer using the elevation setting Relative to the Scene" class="imgs">
            <h4>Absolute Height</h4>
            <img src="img/AbsoluteHeight.png" alt="image showcasing sample points in scene viewer using the elevation setting Absolute Height" class="imgs">
            <p> 
            These four options serve different purposes and for the means to show 2d points all the options end up with the same result expect for absolute does not work without a z value. With The 3D points I used for testing it seamed that 
            the Absolute height yielded the most accurate results for our field map data. So I tried and added some points and editing the elevation field in the data to see the result. The edited showed no change to the scene view and no matter what changes i 
            made to the elevation field in the data it would not update in scene viewer. Testing this further trying to use survey123 data or data with a column that contain elevation/z data will not show changes in elevation at all in a 3D scene. The only one that
            we tested that show elevation was the points collected with field maps.
            <br><br>
            The bellow Image shows a comparison between a untouched point and a edited point. One with the a elevation value of 260 and the other 300. Thee 260 being the unchanged and the 300 being the changed one. even with these changes the one set to 300
            till appears lower than the one at 260. No matter the setting this was always the case.
            </p>

            <h3> Trouble Shooting Setting the Elevation value in Scene Viewer </h3>
            <p> 
                The Next step was to take to google and figure out why this was happening. A couple google searches later and a bit of trouble shooting the answer arose. From a ESRI community form question, the answer was found. Setting the variable that is used to 
                set the elevation value in Scene View is not in the UI and will pull a default no matter what (thats the reason only the field maps worked with z value). Unless you use ArcGIS Online Assistant and edit the json make the scene pull a variable value
                from your feature layer. Although there answer on the form was not 100% accurate and was missing brackets it did lead to the correct answer. Thus we were able to pull elevation data from any Feature layer and display those points in a 3D Scene.

            <h3> Conclusion on Scene Viewer </h3>
            <p> 
            Overall felt like the best solution to our problem that we could find especially after we found the json edit workaround. A full walk through of how to edit the json using both the current and new beta ArcGIS Online Assistant will be showcased in our 
            <a href="solutions.html">Solutions</a> section of the website.
